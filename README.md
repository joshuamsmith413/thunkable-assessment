## Features included
* button hover states
* click plus button to see input field and enter a project
* press enter to create a new project
* new project will apear as the input disappears with a date and time 
* clicking plus sign again will repeat previous steps with new items added at the top
* each row can be editted(a new date and time will be added) and deleted with delete having a confirmation prompt
* project state management is done with redux while lesser things are done with local state
* Ant design was used for confirmation prompt

## Wish we had
* more reusable components - some logic/funcitons are duplicated in components could easily be made into helper functions. Also some typography could've been simplified. The new project and edit project could be a single reusable component as well
* tests would have been nice but ran out of time
